# TicTacToe

This is a small Tic Tac Toe game I made for school in 2023.
It's basically two larger while loops in each other and some regex to make sure the input is in range.
It was the first Project in Java that I made.

## Installation

Compile the Code in Eclipse or change it first.

## Usage

prompts are on-screen, it's all German!
